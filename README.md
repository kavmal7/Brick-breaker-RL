## Automated brick breaker
This code file uses reinforcement learning to create an artificial bot for the brick breaker game (breakout). More specifically, we will implement a Deep-Q-Network (DQN) model and compare it with a pre-existing implementation from Stable Baselines 3.

In our current iteration, we will use an existing game API, as we're focused on the ML side of things, but I may try to implement the game manually in the future in order to improve optimisation.

Note: Such models are highly computationally intensive and a good PC is recommended for running the code.
